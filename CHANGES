0.2.1 - 2020-11-25
  Now works with Python 3. Also, Python 2 support is dropped.

  Reads from stdin when run as standalone program (instead of reading
  test.lisp).

  (All changes suggested by Avatar Ben crowell, issue #1.)

0.2 - 2006
  Complete rewrite. Now parses lisp directly, instead of using the
  shlex tokenizer.

  Didn't allow escape sequences for newline/tab/etc. in strings.
  Thanks to Paul Jimenez for pointing this out.

0.1.1
  Fixed a bug in writelisp() which caused complex
  numbers to be converted into strings.

0.1
  Initial release
